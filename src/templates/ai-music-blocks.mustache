      <p>AI Music Blocks is an experimental tool that enables users to create novel and dynamic soundscapes without requiring any coding skills. The tool employs advanced Machine Learning (ML) technology and chunked generation and rendering techniques to produce near-real-time music generation, facilitating experimentation and play.</p>
      <p>The tool's no-code interface allows users to effortlessly snap together pre-built music blocks, including drums, basslines, melodies, harmonies, and more, to create their unique music compositions. The chunked generation and rendering techniques allow the tool to produce music in real-time, providing users with immediate feedback on their creations.</p>
